Workflow of Git
 git fetch-->git pull--> working directory
 git add--> git commit--> git push
 Working directory(project folder)---git add----> Staging area---git commit -m---> Local repo---push---> Central Repo

Git commands:
 1. git version (To check the git version)
 2. git init (To initialize the local repo in our working directory)
 3. git status (To check Untracked files)
 4. git commit -m "Changes made"
 5. git push -u origin main

Git Branching Mechanism:
 git branch--> (To find branches)
 git branch branch name--> (To create branch)
 git checkout branch name--> (To switch one branch to another branch)
 git merge developer--> (To merge our dev-1 code into master branch)
 git branch -D branch name--> (To delete branch)
 git branch -m branch name renaming branch name-->(To rename the branch name)
 git diff filename(text.txt)--> (To resolve conflicts)
 git stash--> (To save temporarily in hidden format)
 git stash list--> (To find temporarily saved files)
 git stash pop--> (To revert into working copy)
 git stash pop stash@{id}--> (To revert into working copy)
 git stash drop stash@{id}--> (To delete temporarily saved files)

Branching Stategy:
 1. name
 2. Long live, short live
 3. source, destination
 4. Merge, how to promote prod
 5. Conflicts resolve

Git Stash: Git stash is a command used to temporarily save changes in your working directory that youâ€™re not ready to commit yet.
Stash makes workflow more flexible and efficient, especially when juggling multiple tasks or branches 

Git rebase: Git rebase is powerfull git command used to integrate changes from one branch to another, but it iwll rewrites commit history to create 
linear progression. It is commonly used to maintain a clean project history and to apply commits from one branch to another.

Merge: Merge preserves the history of how commits were combined and creates a merge commit. This maintain exact history of commits.

Merge Conflicts:
 1. If two branches modify the same lines of code in a file
 2. If one branch renames or moves a file while another branch modifies it
 3. If a file deleted in one branch and modified in another branch
