# Multibranch pipeline:

This multibranch pipeline enables us to implement different jenkinsfiles for different branches of the same project
In this pipeline, jenkins automatically discovers, manages, and executes pipelines for branches in Git hub
PR based: Branches get discovered automatically in the pipeline if someone raises PR(Pull Request)
The main advantage of using multibranch pipeline is to build and deploy multiple branches from single repository

# How to trigger pipeline in jenkins when code merge in master"

For this we will use GHPRB--> Github Pull Request Builder Pluggin
In Github, we need to create webhook by giving Payload url., [ie., jenkins IP/ghprbhook/]
And we need to configure GHPRB in jenkins server 
Now we need to create new freestyle project and should configure github and SCM and GHPRB
Once all configuration completed, we need to Push or pull changes into github main branch, a build will be automatically triggerd in Jenkins
